    <!-- A brief introduction about why i created this website in the firt place -->
    <main class="website-objective-section">
      <h1 class="headline">WHY THIS WEBSITE???</h1>
      <p class="objective">
        Learning a language is more than memorizing words â€” itâ€™s about opening doors to new ideas, new cultures, and new ways of thinking. I created this website as a dedicated space for my niece and me to walk that journey together, from the very first word to a confident, fluent understanding of English.

        This isnâ€™t a flashy platform or a high-pressure course. Itâ€™s a carefully crafted guide â€” simple, focused, and full of intention. Each lesson reflects what I believe matters most: clarity, consistency, and connection. I designed it not just to teach grammar or vocabulary, but to build the kind of natural fluency that grows from curiosity and purpose.

        Most of all, this site is an expression of care â€” for my nieceâ€™s future and for the learning process itself. My hope is that this quiet corner of the internet becomes a companion in her growth â€” and maybe even a resource for others who want to learn with meaning, not just speed.
